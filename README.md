The Electricity Leakage and Monitoring System is an Arduino-based  project that uses the ESP32 to monitor AC power parameters, calculate  power consumption, and display real-time data through the Blynk app for  efficient home energy management.
The Electricity Leakage and monitoring system is an Arduino-based project that uses an ESP32
microcontroller to monitor and display the electrical parameters of a single-phase AC power supply.
The system uses two sensors: the ZMPT101B voltage sensor and SCT013 current sensor, to measure
the voltage and current of the AC power supply respectively. The voltage and current measurements
are then used to calculate the power consumption and by using the Blynk app to display the power
consumption in real-time and to provide a user friendly cloud based interface to represent the power
usage. The ZMPT101B voltage sensor is calibrated to compensate for any voltage drop across the
voltage divider circuit. The SCT013 current sensor is capable of measuring up to 30 A of current,
which is suitable for most household applications. The project is ideal for home automation and
energy management, allowing users to monitor their power consumption and optimize their energy
usage.
